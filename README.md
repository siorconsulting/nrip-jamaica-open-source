# Toolset for National Risk Information Platform in Jamaica

Open-source tools developed for National Risk Information Platform (NRIP) project in Jamaica in 2021.

## Project Context - National Risk Information Platform (NRIP)

The National Risk Information Platform (NRIP) is a multi-hazard risk information platform that will allow users to visualize risk data and perform analysis on various elements of risk data in Jamaica (http://nripja.com/). Its purpose is to promote a culture of safety and risk reduction by providing access to knowledge and information on hazard, vulnerability, exposure and loss and making it available for decision-making in development and land use planning, investments in social, economic and environmental sectors and risk transfer strategies. 

The NRIP is conceptualized as a platform that provides users with the ability to visualize and interact with hazard, vulnerability, and risk data through a series of map layers that can be activated and deactivated based on scenarios or analysis that the user wishes to perform. Each map layer will have supporting attribute data, as well as links to detailed information on hazards, vulnerability and losses contained in tables, photographs and reports that provide added information for location-specific analyses. In addition to the map feature, an NRIP module will include a community of practice that operates as a discussion forum for specialists and practitioners to share views, discuss ideas and concepts and suggest recommendations for best practices that benefit the sector (https://nripja.discoursehosting.net/). 

Sior Consulting Ltd. (https://siorconsulting.com/) supported the development of the platform by undertaking data manipulation, particularly LiDAR-driven data derivation for coastal, hydrological and geomorphological hazards in three study locations in Jamaica, and developing risk modelling toolsets (as provided here) and case studies to showcase the capabilities and outputs of the analysis tools.
